      <p className="my-description">
        As a final-year Computer Science student specializing in full-stack
        development, I've honed my skills in both client- side and server-side
        development. My passion lies in tackling technical challenges, and I
        pride myself on my strong self-learning capabilities. Every day, I
        strive to deepen my expertise and expand my horizons. I'm on the lookout
        for internship opportunities that will allow me to refine my skills in a
        practical setting and eager to immerse myself in challenging development
        roles that will stretch my abilities and broaden my understanding of the
        field.
